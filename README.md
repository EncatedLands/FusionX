# FUSION-X
## A software for Minecraft:Bedrock Servers

## What is this?

- FusionX is a forked software for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. This software is mainly only
  an extension for EncatedLands server, but will still work on other servers. Note that some API
  of this software from the original may change.

- Since FusionX is a fork of the original PocketMine-MP, some plugins may not support
  this.

- The software is still under development, and can cause unexpected server crashes or plugin
  errors. This is not yet stable for some large servers to use

## Software Version

- 1.0.0-beta
